# Crowdfunding DApp

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) allows users to create and manage fundraising campaigns using blockchain technology. The DApp ensures transparency by making all transactions verifiable on the Fantom blockchain. 
Users can connect their MetaMask wallets to create campaigns, donate to others, and track contributions. The DApp is deployed on the Fantom testnet using Thirdweb.

## Features

- **MetaMask Integration**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the DApp.
